# **Workflow**

- Make sure to keep your fork synced [(info on how to keep your fork synced)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced)
- Select and "claim" an issue so to keep a smooth workflow and prevent conflicts
- Create a new branch (and name your branch something that relates to the issue your working on) to perform your work on and make your commits
- When ready, push your branch up to your repository then create a pull request to merge it into the master repository

## **GUI**

# **FlashCards Development Toolchain**

This document summarizes the necessary toolchain for developers contributing to the FlashCards project.

The basic tools include: a JDK, NetBeans 8.2 IDE (or any IDE/environment as long as Apache Ant is installed), and the Git version control software. 

# **JDK**

Make sure you have a JDK by running the command `javac -version`. If there is an error, you either need to download an installer package [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), or possibly set your PATH.

# **NETBEANS**

Download NetBeans 8.2 [here](https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/) or [here](https://netbeans.org/community/releases/82/index.html)

# **GIT**

If using Linux, Git will probably already be installed.

If using Windows, download an installer package [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

If using Mac, download an installer package [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

After installing Git, run the command `git --version` to get the version and make sure it's installed on your machine

# **APACHE ANT**

If you are not using the NetBeans IDE, you need to make sure to install Ant so you can build your java files.
